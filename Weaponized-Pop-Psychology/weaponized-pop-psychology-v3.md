# Parasocial Communities Beyond Digital Vigilantism.

## Digilal Vigilantism

One of the most common form of online direct action we often see in the information space is a digital adaptation of crowd justice adorned with semi-anonymous vigilantism. The action will typically follow a transgression of the collectively, and often arbitrarily established moral standard that encompasses the most common affinities of a collective, and often strive to expose it.

In this section I will elaborate upon some of the subjects elaborated in this article [this 2018 article about class divide impacting online activism](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/65/1/51/4795348) and use it to remain grounded towards the reflexion I would like to perhaps generate.

What the article outlines the most is the assymetry is the means of resource acquisition among digital vigilantism however the parasocial aspect is overlooked. We can form solid communities revolving around parasocial principles. I am a person interacting with the web, I recognize the people in this "web" are real people and associate socially in a selective manner with some of them.

There is not expectation of social responsibility, the community I am engaging in does not HAVE to provide me with purpose, I do not HAVE to provide it legitimacy and respect. This exchange occurs only if everyone involved consents.

As an aspiring [Psychic War](https://pondscum.gg/psychic-war/) contributor I have accepted that it is highly unlikely human right violations and political extremism that leads to fascist policies can be reversed, or even opposed effectively in the material world therefore Psychic Warfare is necessary.

I think that the online opposition to those types of violations already exists and is gaining momentum and initiative through grassroots movements on the internet and I would love to share my experience with such maters with anyone who finds this blog post.

There are 3 main aspects of organisaing a socialist-coded grassroot community:

### 1. *(Ideological)* _**Relating individual perspectives to causes.**_

    This aspect of communication involves how individuals interpret, frame, and relate to a cause based on their own beliefs, values, and experiences. It shapes personal alignment with online communities and the motivation to engage with them in various aspects.

        - Framing and narrative control.

        - Selective exposure and echo chambers.

        - Access to information.

### 2. *(Organisational)* _**Organising and moderating communities.**_

    This refers to the ability to structure, mobilize, and sustain collective engagement within a collective. It includes coordination, decision-making, and resource allocation.

        - Coordination from a core of trusted members allowing for some form of transparency among strangers.

        - Decision-making, voting/veto, consensus, leverage.

        - Fundraising and resource allocation.

### 3. *(Political)* _**Negotiating shared realities with outsiders.**_

    This aspect involves the ability to engage with institutions, media, and the general public to legitimize action and push for their ideals to be put into some form of action.

        - Marketing, Propaganda, Raising Awareness, Popular Education.

        - Non Violent Direct Action, Assembly, Training, Legal implications (common law).

        - Militant Competition, Schisms, Intersectional Strife.
