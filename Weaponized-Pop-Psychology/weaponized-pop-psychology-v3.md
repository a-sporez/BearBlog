## Digilal Vigilantism.

One of the most common form of online direct action we often see in the information space is a digital adaptation of crowd justice adorned with semi-anonymous vigilantism. The action will typically follow a transgression of the collectively, and often arbitrarily established moral standard that encompasses the most common affinities of a collective, and often strive to expose it.

In this section I will elaborate upon the basic structure of [this 2018 article about class divide impacting online activism](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/65/1/51/4795348) and adapt it to the contemporary era however the subject discussed is different.

As an aspiring [Psychic War](https://pondscum.gg/psychic-war/) contributor I have accepted that it is highly unlikely human right violations and political extremism that leads to fascist policies can be reversed, or even opposed effectively in the material world therefore Psychic Warfare is necessary.

Let's instead break down the 3 methods of communication outlined in the article and compare how digital vigilantism approached issues separated by over a decade.

### 1. *(Ideological)* _**Relating individual perspectives to causes.**_

    This aspect of communication involves how individuals interpret, frame, and relate to a cause based on their own beliefs, values, and experiences. It shapes personal alignment with online communities and the motivation to engage with them in various aspects.

        - Framing and narrative control.

        - Selective exposure and echo chambers.

        - Access to information.

### 2. *(Organisational)* _**Organising and moderating communities.**_

    This refers to the ability to structure, mobilize, and sustain collective engagement within a collective. It includes coordination, decision-making, and resource allocation.

### 3. *(Political)* _**Negotiating shared realities with outsiders.**_

    This aspect involves the ability to engage with institutions, media, and the general public to legitimize action and push for their ideals to be put into some form of action.
