# Internet Societies, Separation And Propagation.

## Digilal Vigilantism.

One of the most common form of online direct action we often see in the information space is a digital adaptation of crowd justice adorned with semi-anonymous vigilantism. The action will typically follow a transgression of the collectively, and often arbitrarily established moral standard that encompasses the most common affinities of a collective, and often strive to expose it.

In this section I will elaborate upon the basic structure of [this 2018 article about class divide impacting online activism](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/65/1/51/4795348) and adapt it to the contemporary era however the subject discussed is different.

As an aspiring [Psychic War](https://pondscum.gg/psychic-war/) contributor I have accepted that it is highly unlikely human right violations and political extremism that leads to fascist policies can be reversed, or even opposed effectively in the material world therefore Psychic Warfare is necessary.

I think that the online opposition to those types of violations already exists and is gaining momentum and initiative through grassroots movements on the internet and I would love to share my experience with such maters with anyone who finds this blog post.

For context, I have worked for a little over 4 years as a fundraising team leader for Greenpeace Canada, as well as a local volunteer group manager and organiser for a little under 3 years on my spare time.
I have conducted 7 NVDA along the Greepeace banner 5 of which resulted in arrests and prosecution for conspiracy to commit indictable offense, for which justice has been served. So I can speak about it as much as I want.

I have worked mostly on multiple projects aiming to raise awareness about topics such as climate change, sustainable agriculture, nuclear safety regulations, protection of endagered ecossystems. From small time outreach with local communities to NVDA that caused tens of millions of dollars in operational costs to huge corporations.

Some pictures of small projects I helped organised or bigger projects I took part in that are available to the public:

Here is breakdown of how I learned to organise non violent civil disobedience during these years and hopefully I can wrap it up into a useful tool for today's non violent civil action enthusiasts.
I find it's helpful to break down more complicated tasks into smaller more simple tasks that are easy to be assigned to other people you rely on or at least assign within your workflow if you are working by yourself. There are 3 main aspects of organisaing a grassroot community:

### 1. *(Ideological)* _**Relating individual perspectives to causes.**_

    This aspect of communication involves how individuals interpret, frame, and relate to a cause based on their own beliefs, values, and experiences. It shapes personal alignment with online communities and the motivation to engage with them in various aspects.

        - Framing and narrative control.

        - Selective exposure and echo chambers.

        - Access to information.

### 2. *(Organisational)* _**Organising and moderating communities.**_

    This refers to the ability to structure, mobilize, and sustain collective engagement within a collective. It includes coordination, decision-making, and resource allocation.

        - Coordination from a core of trusted members allowing for some form of transparency among strangers.

        - Decision-making, voting/veto, consensus, leverage.

        - Fundraising and resource allocation.

### 3. *(Political)* _**Negotiating shared realities with outsiders.**_

    This aspect involves the ability to engage with institutions, media, and the general public to legitimize action and push for their ideals to be put into some form of action.

        - Marketing, Propaganda, Raising Awareness, Popular Education.

        - Non Violent Direct Action, Assembly, Training, Legal implications (common law).

        - Militant Competition, Schisms, Intersectional Strife.
