# Mortification, Medical and Personal Hesitancy.

One of the biggest obstacle to my individuation and healing process was undoubtedly my own self-destructive traits.

I don't mean to diagnose myself or anyone with complicated personality disorders, I am obviously not qualified to do that. I mean to talk about a trait that inhabits most if not all humans and arises whenever we are not entirely honest about who we truly are for a multitude of reasons.

This doesn't happen out of a vacuum, there are many reasons for people to hide who they truly are that are valid and plenty that are not, however no matter what your intentions are this trait can arise within your subconscious mind. We cannot get rid of it at any moment in our lives, it is important to understand the danger that it represents for ourselves and for others if it governs how we make decisions.

## **Mortification**

Mortification, as described by Sam Vaknin, refers to the profound fear and distress experienced when someone's carefully constructed self-image, or "ideal self," is threatened or exposed as inauthentic.

+ *Loss of Control*: People often interact with their internalized perceptions of others rather than engaging with them directly. When someone else's unpredictable behavior—such as criticism or perceived humiliation—disrupts these perceptions, it can create a sense of losing control over both internal and external realities.

+ *Confrontation with the Authentic Self*: Situations that expose one's true traits, especially those perceived as undesirable, can force a confrontation with the authentic self. This exposure may challenge the image of an idealized or "better" self that one strives to maintain.

+ *Overwhelming Feelings of Terror and Helplessness*: The experience of such moments can be intensely destabilizing, leading to feelings of helplessness or even existential fear. These emotions can feel especially disruptive when they conflict with one's self-image of being in control or strong.

+ *Resorting to Coping Mechanisms*: In response to these challenges, individuals may turn to coping strategies such as heightened self-focus, denial, or idealizing certain aspects of themselves in an attempt to reassert a sense of balance and protect against perceived threats.

Vaknin highlights that while these experiences are deeply uncomfortable, they can also present opportunities for growth. Facing these moments constructively can help someone align more closely with their authentic self and foster resilience.

This concept has also been described as "the primitive terror of self-dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self." Such moments can lead to feelings of shame and a temporary loss of inner stability. However, with the right tools and support, these experiences can serve as a catalyst for self-understanding and personal development.

Indulging in radical ideologies is in many ways a collective orgy of constant mortification, or more like futile attempts to avoid it... I'm not sure exactly but I guess this is the purpose of this post, to incentivise discussions about this phenomenon, however you may like to call it.

## **Hyperobjects**

I would like to turn your attention towards the concept of hyperobjects. Timothy Morton defines hyperobjects as entities so massively distributed across time and space that they transcend traditional notions of individuality and locality. Examples include climate change, nuclear materials, and capitalism. [Timothy Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton)

And from this concept arises the idea of hyperassassination as skillfully brought up by Smugbug of the Pondscum Collective.

(**WIP**)

Ideological extremism appeals to a futile attempt at creating a hyper-object of personality... a fantasy that is attractive to a specific type of person that can provide a specific type of external validation.
