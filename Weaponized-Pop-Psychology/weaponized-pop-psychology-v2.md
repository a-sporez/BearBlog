# Mortification, Why Do We Hesitate To Get Better?

One of the biggest obstacle to my individuation and healing process was undoubtedly my own self-destructive traits.

I don't mean to diagnose myself or anyone with complicated personality disorders, I am obviously not qualified to do that. I mean to talk about a trait that inhabits most if not all humans and arises whenever we are not entirely honest about who we truly are for a multitude of reasons.

This doesn't happen out of a vacuum, there are many reasons for people to hide who they truly are that are valid and plenty that are not, however no matter what your intentions are this trait can arise within your subconscious mind. We cannot get rid of it at any moment in our lives, it is important to understand the danger that it represents for ourselves and for others if it governs how we make decisions.

Our personality and ideologies are often mixed up and used like objects, we projects them out into the world and interact with others while attempting to remain as consistent as we can with our own perceived true self, the "ideal self".

## **Mortification**

Mortification, as described by Sam Vaknin, refers to th the profound fear and distress experienced when someone's carefully constructed self-image, or "ideal self," is threatened or exposed as inauthentic.

+ *Loss of Control*: People often interact with their internalized perceptions of others rather than engaging with them directly. When someone else's unpredictable behavior—such as criticism or perceived humiliation—disrupts these perceptions, it can create a sense of losing control over both internal and external realities.

+ *Confrontation with the Authentic Self*: Situations that expose one's true traits, especially those perceived as undesirable, can force a confrontation with the authentic self. This exposure may challenge the image of an idealized or "better" self that one strives to maintain.

+ *Overwhelming Feelings of Terror and Helplessness*: The experience of such moments can be intensely destabilizing, leading to feelings of helplessness or even existential fear. These emotions can feel especially disruptive when they conflict with one's self-image of being in control or strong.

+ *Resorting to Coping Mechanisms*: In response to these challenges, individuals may turn to coping strategies such as heightened self-focus, denial, or idealizing certain aspects of themselves in an attempt to reassert a sense of balance and protect against perceived threats.

Vaknin highlights that while these experiences are deeply uncomfortable, they can also present opportunities for growth. Facing these moments constructively can help someone align more closely with their authentic self and foster resilience.

This concept has also been described as "the primitive terror of self-dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self." Such moments can lead to feelings of shame and a temporary loss of inner stability. However, with the right tools and support, these experiences can serve as a catalyst for self-understanding and personal development.

My thougts on this concept and why I bring it up in a blog post?

Indulging in radical ideologies is in many ways a collective orgy of constant mortification, or more like futile attempts to avoid it... I'm not sure exactly but I guess this is the purpose of this post, to incentivise discussions about this phenomenon, however you may like to call it.

The framework of an ideology is meant to first provide a solid foundation for individual personalities to stand on and withstand the constant mortification that is required to routinely question your own moral compass and adapt to new information as it is presented.

_**In other words, Ideology provides an alternative to admitting that we might be wrong.**_

## **Hyperobjects**

I would like to turn your attention towards the concept of hyperobjects. Timothy Morton defines hyperobjects as entities so massively distributed across time and space that they transcend traditional notions of individuality and locality. Examples include climate change, nuclear materials, and capitalism.

[Timothy Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton)

And from this concept arises the idea of hyperassassination as skillfully brought up by Smugbug of the Pondscum Collective.

[Podscum Collective: HYPER-ASSASINATION](https://pondscum.gg/hyper-assassination/)

The Pondscum Collective introduces the concept as a radical response to people who have become embodiments of hyperobjects—termed "Hypermen". These Hypermen are seen as carriers, or vessels through which the huge structures of power and influence operate, making them memetic representations of systems beyond individual human understanding like capitalism. The act of hyperassassination is portrayed as an attempt to disrupt these systems by removing their flesh bag representatives.

*And this is when I though I could add to the Pondscum Collective's discussion by comapring it to the process of mortification.*

In my opinion, and in most circumstances that we can generally relate around, Ideological extremism appeals to a futile attempt at creating a hyper-object of personality... a fantasy that is attractive to a specific type of person that can provide a specific type of external validation.

**Luigi Mangione might have attempted to annoint himself as a hyperman instead of seeking treatment.**

## **Don't Hesitate To Get Better**

It is still unclear what we know about the exact psychological state and personality profile of Mangione.

However there have been some indications that he suffered from back pain and depression occasionally. Ironically, this would not really have been a problem for him, he was not in a situation where healthcare was not available to him.

[LEA SKENE and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER, AP News](https://apnews.com/article/luigi-mangione-back-surgery-mental-health-35086d2e01089f53db7b95e7b6c683e4#:~:text=Luigi%20Mangione%2C%20the%20suspect%20in,more%20suffering%2C”%20Gulur%20said.)

Additionally, there seems to be indications that he was socially isolated and struggling with maintaining a firm personality despite being typically considered to be a succesful person, which probably compounded his loneliness since the people around him were most likely unable to identify that he was lonely.

[David Hanscom, Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/anxiety-another-name-for-pain/202412/mangione-tragedy-pain-isolation-and-the-survival-response)

He chose very bad coping mechanisms and most likely tried to immortalize himself by doing something dramatic... **Which I have to admit is something I have done many times in my life** albeit with ways that were positive... Luigi is not doing so fine, his mental heath has only been degrading ever since his arrest and his inability to form healthy coping mechanisms is still at the core of his struggles.

**We are Apes** and as such we tend to identify reality through associations, thanks to our mirror neurons. When I see an injustice go unnoticed my first reaction is to want to do something about it, anything. Then my rational subconscious module starts to interact with every other subconscious modules to determine the feasabilty and the extent of that action. Most of the time, there is nothing much that that comes out of it. If I manage to take notes and write about it later is great but most of the time it gets lots in the ocean of variably relevant comments out on the internet.

The human mind has an incredible ability to imagine things that are beyond comprehension, and express it in a multitude of ways. Mortification and personality development that might ensue is first and foremost a feature of imagination.
