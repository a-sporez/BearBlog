# Mortification, Why Do We Hesitate To Be Ourselves?

One of the biggest obstacle to my individuation and healing process was undoubtedly my own self-destructive traits.

I don't mean to diagnose myself or anyone with complicated personality disorders, I am obviously not qualified to do that. I mean to talk about a trait that inhabits most if not all humans and arises whenever we are not entirely honest about who we truly are for a multitude of reasons.

This doesn't happen out of a vacuum, there are many reasons for people to hide who they truly are that are valid and plenty that are not, however no matter what your intentions are this trait can arise within your subconscious mind. We cannot get rid of it at any moment in our lives, it is important to understand the danger that it represents for ourselves and for others if it governs how we make decisions.

## **Mortification**

Mortification, as described by Sam Vaknin, refers to this trait the profound fear and distress experienced when someone's carefully constructed self-image, or "ideal self," is threatened or exposed as inauthentic.

+ *Loss of Control*: People often interact with their internalized perceptions of others rather than engaging with them directly. When someone else's unpredictable behavior—such as criticism or perceived humiliation—disrupts these perceptions, it can create a sense of losing control over both internal and external realities.

+ *Confrontation with the Authentic Self*: Situations that expose one's true traits, especially those perceived as undesirable, can force a confrontation with the authentic self. This exposure may challenge the image of an idealized or "better" self that one strives to maintain.

+ *Overwhelming Feelings of Terror and Helplessness*: The experience of such moments can be intensely destabilizing, leading to feelings of helplessness or even existential fear. These emotions can feel especially disruptive when they conflict with one's self-image of being in control or strong.

+ *Resorting to Coping Mechanisms*: In response to these challenges, individuals may turn to coping strategies such as heightened self-focus, denial, or idealizing certain aspects of themselves in an attempt to reassert a sense of balance and protect against perceived threats.

Vaknin highlights that while these experiences are deeply uncomfortable, they can also present opportunities for growth. Facing these moments constructively can help someone align more closely with their authentic self and foster resilience.

This concept has also been described as "the primitive terror of self-dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self." Such moments can lead to feelings of shame and a temporary loss of inner stability. However, with the right tools and support, these experiences can serve as a catalyst for self-understanding and personal development.

My thougts on this concept and why I bring it up in a blog post?

Indulging in radical ideologies is in many ways a collective orgy of constant mortification, or more like futile attempts to avoid it... I'm not sure exactly but I guess this is the purpose of this post, to incentivise discussions about this phenomenon, however you may like to call it.

The framework of an ideology is meant to first provide a solid foundation for individual personalities to stand on and withstand the constant mortification that is required to routinely question your own moral compass and adapt to new information as it is presented.

_**In other words, Ideology provides an alternative to admitting that we might be wrong.**_

## **Hyperobjects**

I would like to turn your attention towards the concept of hyperobjects. Timothy Morton defines hyperobjects as entities so massively distributed across time and space that they transcend traditional notions of individuality and locality. Examples include climate change, nuclear materials, and capitalism. [Timothy Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton)

And from this concept arises the idea of hyperassassination as skillfully brought up by Smugbug of the Pondscum Collective.
[Podscum Collective: HYPER-ASSASINATION](https://pondscum.gg/hyper-assassination/)

The Pondscum Collective introduces the concept as a radical response to people who have become embodiments of hyperobjects—termed "Hypermen". These Hypermen are seen as carriers, or vessels through which the huge structures of power and influence operate, making them memetic representations of systems beyond individual human understanding like capitalism. The act of hyperassassination is portrayed as an attempt to disrupt these systems by removing their flesh bag representatives.

*And this is when I though I could add to the Pondscum Collective's discussion by comapring it to the process of mortification.*

In my opinion, and in most circumstances that we can generally relate around, Ideological extremism appeals to a futile attempt at creating a hyper-object of personality... a fantasy that is attractive to a specific type of person that can provide a specific type of external validation.

**We are Apes** and as such we tend to identify reality through associations, thanks to our mirror neurons. When I see an injustice go unnoticed my first reaction is to want to do something about it, anything. Then my rational subconscious module starts to interact with every other subconscious modules to determine the feasabilty and the extent of that action. Most of the time, there is nothing much that that comes out of it. If I manage to take notes and write about it later is great but most of the time it gets lots in the ocean of variably relevant comments out on the internet.

The human mind has an incredible ability to imagine things that are beyond comprehension, and express it in a multitude of ways. One of the ways we communicate is
