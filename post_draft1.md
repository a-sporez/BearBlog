## Modus Operandi

The way disinformation

### *Seeding*

The first step of Russian DIP is to seed disinformation in the information space they intend to operate in

## Was it the Russians all along??

Well, depending who you are talking to, you might benefit from answering yes or no to this question, that is not the point of this post however... I hope the person reading this can come up to their own conclusions.
I personally do not believe in a global hegemonic conspiracy theory. Conspiracies occur all the time often times in plain sight and are inherent to the human experience, we only pay attention to a fraction of those conspiracies for a multitude of reasons.

*The reason why this matters is because delving into Russian media from the perspective of a disgruntled democracy enjoyer is rather pleasant. The terrible narratives we hear coming out of Russia are often not part of the Russian information sphere*

* Russians did not create or breed the type of disinformation I am describing as Russian, I am using this terminology to define it while being deployed as a component of the Russian state's media apparatus.

* I cannot pretend to know everything there is to know about Deceptive Imagery Persuasion nor do I know where this type of disinformation orginates from precisely. I am simply seeing patterns and writing about them on a blog. I invite feedback and criticism of any kind, my perspective is not immutable.

* The Russian state media and it's methods does not represent all Russians, in fact many Russians choose not to engage with political commentary for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with politics, they are simply doing the best they can to live their lives much like you and I.

With that said, let's start by breaking down what exactly the Russian state's media apparatus is because engaging with a vaguely defined concept is not a sensible way to engage with the complexity of this world.

First of all, if you did not already know, media in Russia is heavily influenced by the state to various extents. There are no considerable pushbacks to the directives coming from the state among thoese media outlets, either because they are directly owned by the state or by oligarchs that have close ties to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.
While some media companies are privately owned, publishing news or content that does not align with the Kremlin supposedly leads to harsh consequences although the exact nature of those consequences is often vaguely alluded to.

Media outlets must comply with Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision of Communications) regulations, which can lead to fines or blocking for non-compliance.
The most typical methods to enforce censorship is to prosecute any detractor for being a foreign agent. Some examples:

- Dozhd TV (TV Rain): Labeled as a foreign agent and forced to shut down its operations in Russia, later resuming abroad. [source](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russia-declares-media-outlet-tv-rain-foreign-agent-2021-08-20/)

- Meduza: Declared a foreign agent, which significantly impacted its ability to operate within Russia. [source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/07/18/russias-liberal-dozhd-tv-returns-to-the-air-after-wartime-crackdown-a78332)

- Novaya Gazeta: Closed down in 2022 due to its independent reporting and critical stance toward the state. [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62216940)

## Means of Control

### *Direct Ownership*

**All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK)** is a holdings corporation entirely owned by the state, it includes the international branch of Russia Today and multiple media outlets around Russia.
Along with RT, it is pretty much the central nervous system of Russian state media. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom_in_Russia)

They have been investigated for engaging in nefarious activities to exert influence on other nations such as offering sponsorship to content creators that promote certain narraties in the United States social media sphere. [source](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2559)

### *Partial Ownership*
Another reason why we do not see Russian news outlets criticize the Kremlin positions is because they are partially owned by the Russia state through different means.

**Channel One Russia (Pervyj Kanal)**  is 51% state-owned. All of the remaining shares are held by private entities, including National Media Group and VTB Bank. They are probably the most popular channel in Russia and put a mix of news and entertainment.

**Gazprom-Media** is a subsidiary of Gazprom, in which Vladimir Putin holds a controlling stake. They own a national television channel but also purchased international media outlets like NRJ, TNT, Match TV.
*Personal Note*; When I was younger I indulged in activism with Greenpeace and one of my friend was a Boson on the MV Arctic Sunrise when it attempted to board a Gazprom oil rig, they were immediately arrested by FSB officers that were stationed on the rig. Here is a picture of one of them arresting the activists... with a knife.

### *Other Outlets*

While it is technically allowed for Russian media to publish a wide variety of content, the state can always Veto the administrative board or simply block access to private outlets. Russians are allowed to criticize the state, like content creators can do it, they are just not allowed to be popular while doing it within Russia. The Russian state benefits from allowing people to speak their minds, it only won't allow it to influence policies, if you want to do breadtubing with political flavor in Russia, you will not make any money, you will be miserable, the only way for you to survive is to look elsewhere for monetization.

This means that there is a considerable portion of media influence exerted in Russia that is simply unregulated, they have a very diverse independent media scene that is for the most part unpoliticized. The Russian state still tries to exert control over this scene by "allowing" independent media that is generally supportive of the Russian protectionnist ideal to engage in political topics over Telegram channels.
The topic of military propaganda in support of the Russian occupation of Ukraine for example has been largely pushed around Russian media through independent "milblogs"
