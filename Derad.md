I could go on about things I have accomplished and some would consider it a sufficient way to describe it.

Truth is, a lot of the ways use to explain our selves come from everyone around us, everyone that has an impact however small on how we observe and adapt to in our environment.

I remember some old WW2 documentary that was airing on TV back in the 90's there was a veteran speaking that said something that stuck with me. He was saying how he felt his job as a military officer was a bit like him being a carpenter at home.
He needed a bunch of nails and some boards, whenever a nail broke or if a board chipped, it was simply discarded without second though. When the day was done, he was left with whatever he had left in his workshop and had to make do until he went to the store to buy new ones.

Unfuckable minds. I have become Gup, controller of forward airs.

### Accepting the inconsequential nature of my individual existence.

The first casualty in my reality was my self. It died so many times, and as much as I would like to claim to be some sort of illuminated Buddhist skillfully weighing 3 tons of flax on a scale, that is not the meaning of this platitude.


_**I have been, oh so wrong about my self, so many times... is it a bad thing?**_


Deradicalizing to me felt like being left with the crumbs and bits of vegetables around a picnic, I find myself exponentially delving into everything I can find that feels like a clue.

I hang on to the hope that I can leave some clues around.

- While you may have said and done things in the past that are regrettable to various extent, there often is an opportunity to make up for it. Accept the consequences of your bad decisions.

- Acknowledge that the internal relationship you have with your own intuition has been broken, maybe multiple times in differnt ways. You will be wrong again, you will mess up again and it's normal, 

- I have never heard of a person that deradicalized in one single decision or by making one single change. It is a long process somewhat similar to psychological trauma.

- Politics does not always occur at the councils, in the news or on social media. The largest portion of political topics that influences your personality occur inside of your imagination as well as your rational mind. They may be accurate or inaccurate, but remember that they were never part of the material world.

- Ignoring political subjects to distance yourself from radical ideas will merely push you to radicalize into a proportionately opposite side of the dichotmy you have just escaped. The grievances that lead you to be radical in the first place are real, they need to be identified clearly and addressed.


The assessment is based on an integration of academic literature, research reports, and real-world case studies from fields like psychology, sociology, criminology, and counter-terrorism. It draws from general knowledge of well-regarded frameworks, including:

1. **Scholarly Research**: Academic studies on radicalization and deradicalization processes, such as those published in journals like *Terrorism and Political Violence* or *Studies in Conflict & Terrorism*.
   - Researchers like John Horgan, Fathali Moghaddam, and Scott Atran have contributed extensively to understanding these processes.

2. **Practical Frameworks**: Deradicalization and disengagement programs developed by governments, NGOs, and international bodies.
   - Examples include the Saudi Arabian deradicalization program, the Danish Aarhus Model, and the UK’s Prevent strategy.

3. **Best Practices from Multidisciplinary Approaches**:
   - Insights from clinical psychology for addressing trauma and identity issues.
   - Sociology’s exploration of group dynamics and identity formation.
   - Media literacy programs combating disinformation and propaganda.

4. **Global Case Studies**:
   - Programs aimed at rehabilitating former extremists, like ISIS returnees or far-right adherents.
   - Community-level initiatives that work with families and local leaders.

5. **Human Rights and Ethical Guidelines**:
   - Documents like the United Nations' *Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism* emphasize ethical approaches and respect for human rights in counter-extremism efforts.

This synthesis ensures the principles are grounded in research while being actionable in various real-world contexts. If you'd like, I can point you to specific examples or studies for further reading!
