### 1. What is a false self?

Whenever information is released and narrative starts forming around it, there is a lot of processes that start to occur within the mind of an average person who is consuming this information before it influences the conclusions they might establish.

**Quick dive into pop psychology**

 *Persona and Shadow, Self vs. Ego (Carl Jung)*
   - The persona is the mask we wear to adapt to societal roles, while the shadow contains suppressed parts of the self. 
   - The ego creates a false sense of identity, but individuation integrates the true self beyond societal roles.

 *True and False Self Distinction (Donald Winnicott)*
   - The false self arises as a defense mechanism when a child adapts excessively to meet parental expectations, stifling the true self.
   - The true self is spontaneous and authentic, while the false self is a compliant facade for social survival.

 *Splitting and Defense Mechanisms (Melanie Klein)*
   - False self-development links to splitting, where idealization and repression protect the psyche from perceived threats.

 *Narcissistic Defenses (Heinz Kohut)*
   - A fragile self-identity can lead to constructing a false self to gain validation and stave off inner emptiness.

 *Authenticity vs. Inauthenticity (Rollo May)*
   - Authentic living requires confronting existential anxiety, while the false self avoids it through conformity.

 *Being and Seeming (Erich Fromm)*
   - Societal pressures push individuals to prioritize "seeming" (external appearance) over "being" (true self-expression).

### **Puer Complex (Eternal Youth Archetype)**  
1. **Puer Aeternus (Marie-Louise von Franz)**  
   - Refers to individuals who remain emotionally or psychologically fixed in adolescence, avoiding adult responsibilities.  

2. **Positive and Negative Manifestations**  
   - Positive: Creativity, spontaneity, and visionary thinking.  
   - Negative: Avoidance of commitment, escapism, and dependence on others.

3. **Shadow of the Puer (Carl Jung)**  
   - The "Senex" archetype (rigidity and pessimism) often appears as the Puer's neglected shadow, creating imbalance.

4. **Mother Complex (Jungian Context)**  
   - Overattachment to a mother figure may contribute to the Puer’s reluctance to embrace adulthood.

5. **Individuation and Growth**  
   - Overcoming the Puer Complex involves integrating both youthful creativity and mature responsibility.

### **Dunning-Kruger Effect**  
6. **Definition and Origins (David Dunning & Justin Kruger)**  
   - Cognitive bias where people with low competence overestimate their abilities, while experts often underestimate theirs.

7. **Illusory Superiority**  
   - Novices often lack the metacognitive ability to recognize their incompetence.

8. **Stages of Competence**  
   - Moves from unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence as skills develop.

9. **Impacts on Decision-Making**  
   - Leads to overconfidence in fields requiring expertise and hinders collaborative work or learning.

10. **Overcoming the Effect**  
    - Encouraging humility, self-assessment, and continuous learning mitigates the bias.

### **Related Concepts**

#### *Jungian and Archetypal Connections*  
11. **Individuation and the Puer Complex**  
    - Balancing youthful idealism with pragmatic adulthood as part of self-realization.

12. **Hero’s Journey (Joseph Campbell)**  
    - The Puer is akin to the “Call to Adventure” stage; maturity comes through challenges and integration.

#### *Psychological Biases and Self-Perception*  
13. **Impostor Syndrome**  
    - Often the inverse of Dunning-Kruger; individuals doubt their abilities despite achievements.

14. **Overconfidence Effect**  
    - Similar to Dunning-Kruger but applies broadly across competencies and decision-making.

15. **Growth Mindset (Carol Dweck)**  
    - The antidote to biases like Dunning-Kruger: believing in the ability to improve through effort and learning.

#### *Social and Cultural Impacts*  
19. **Cultural Glorification of Youth**  
    - Media and societal trends can perpetuate the Puer Aeternus archetype by overvaluing youth and devaluing age.

20. **Workplace Impacts of Cognitive Biases**  
    - Dunning-Kruger often leads to poor decision-making in leadership and team dynamics.

## - Russian Deceptive Imagery Persuasion.
    + [ ] Typically uses factual information, videos, pictures, mix of semi-reliable OSINT.
    + [ ] Garnished with a narrative aiming towards a collective topic of disinformation.
    + [ ] "Outsider" perspectives, trying to sway the influence that the information has on social media.
    + [ ] Typically followed by a lot of generic support in comments, the responses to those comments is typically polarized and patterns can be identified.
    + [ ] Second wave of disinformation, emphasis on most commmon responses, "outsider" perspective starts investigating.
 
 NOTE: The process tends to be an arrested development, the sort of "investigation" that seems to be occuring within the pieces of media never reaches a satisfying conclusion and the content is replaced by another narrative using the same process.

 	+ [ ] Holy defenders of Palestine
 	+ [ ] "right side of history"
 	+ [ ] closet antisemitism as an identity crisis
 	+ [ ] attempts to reach high factuality thresholds by amending dubiously related information
 	+ [x] Political conviction is often treated as a social standing.

#### - Footnote

I think it's important to outline that most disinformation campaign is based upon real grievances towards which we should remain empathetic and adressing those grievances in more sensible ways might be one of the more constructive open door inside of the misinformed mind.
The grievance might be a direct experience the person you are observing or interacting with has been through but it can also be the simple desire to empathize with the grievance that might motivate the conclusions they choose to make based on the information available to them.
