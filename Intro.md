Welcome to my picnic, or what is left of it. Who am I? Well I am me of course, I can't be anyone else.

I guess I could go on about things I have accomplished and some would consider it a sufficient way to describe who I am. Perhaps this is how you feel about yourself?

On my part, I cannot really say for certain who I am, I feel like a lot of the ways I come with to explain my existence are taken from people all around me, and I am at peace with this idea.

I remember some old WW2 documentary that was airing on TV back in the 90's there was a veteran speaking that said something that stuck with me. He was saying how he felt his job as a military officer was a bit like him being a carpenter at home.
He needed a bunch of nails and some boards, whenever a nail broke or if a board chipped, it was simply discarded without second though.

The first casualty in my reality was my self. It died so many times, and as much as I would like to claim to be some sort of illuminated Buddhist skillfully weighing 3 tons of flax on a scale, that s not what I mean.

I have been, oh so wrong, so many times... but it's OK.
